If the target is still Standing after being pushed back, and if this player was able to follow-up, this player must then perform a second block action against the same target, again following-up if the target is pushed back. If this player performing a Blitz action, performing a second Block action will also cost them one square of their Movement Allowance. If this player has no Movement Allowance left to perform a second Block action, they must Rush to do so. If they cannot Rush, they cannot perform a second Block action. Note that if an opposition player in possession of the ball is pushed back into your End Zone and is still standing, a touchdown will be scored, ending the drive. In this case, the second Block action is not performed. A player with this skill cannot also have Grab skill.</td>
