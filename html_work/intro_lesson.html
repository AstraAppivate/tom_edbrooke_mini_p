If the total is higher than the target's strength characteristic, this player increases their strength characteristic to be equal to that of the target of the Block action, before counting offensive or defensive assists, for the duration of this Block action. If this player has another Skill that allows them to perform more than one Block action, such as Frenzy, they must make a Dauntless roll before each separate Block action is performed.</td>

However, the player that pushed them back may continue to move as part of a Blitz action if they have Movement Allowance remaining or by Rushing. The skill cannot be used when this player is chain-pushed, against a player with Ball and Chain trait or against a player with the Juggernaut skill that performed the Block action as part of a Blitz.</td>
